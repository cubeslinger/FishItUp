FishItUp! is a RIFT addon that aims to track your fishing activities.

!!! ACTUALLY THIS ADDON IS IN ALPHA STAGE AND HASN'T YET BEEN APPROVED BY TRION !!!

Prerequisites:
--------------
- Auto Loot MUST be activatated. (Rift Menu->Interface->Misc->Auto Loot).
- The Player MUST HAVE a fishing pole in his bags, if more then one is present the one requiring the highest skill will be choosen.
- To cast the Player HAS TO use FishItUps!'s CAST button/icon, otherwise it wont track anything.
- To move windows around the screen you have to RIGHT-click and drag windows.

How To Use:
-----------
As long as autoloot is enabled, you start casting using the icon showing you detected pole, then reel up as usual, but you HAVE TO cast with FishItUp! icon button.

Windows Explanation:
--------------------
- Cast Window: 
  It shows the icon of the highest skill requiring Fishinh Pole you have in your inventory, it is used to begin fishing and 
  casting the fishing target. If you stop fishing and FishItUp! doesn't track it, you can click this icon again to force it 
  to stop tracking.

- Main Window: 
  It tracks zone, subzone if available, number of casts, number of catches and both the current fishing timer and the 
  aggregated session time.

- Loot Window: 
  Even if it's usually closed, it tracks details about what you have fished during this session, if you happened
  to already have fished in that zone, it will show old loots along with the new ones.

- Totals Widow: 
  It shows all your fishing totals divided by zone, clicking on the Zone Name shows detailed infos about what you
  looted there.

Saved Data:
-----------
All characteres share a global save file holding the cache with the detailed data about what is fished. Each character has one more
saved file in its saved data directory holding session and totals data store into the shared cache.

Font:
-----
I use a custom monospaced font taken from https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/monospacetypewriter, it should be free for anyone to use
as long as there is no money involed. The reason why it's used is to try to align text in columns.
