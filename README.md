FishItUp! is a RIFT addon that aims to track you fishing activities.

How To Use:
-----------
As long you have autoloot enabled, you start casting using the icon showing you detected pole, then reel up as usual, but you HAVE TO cast with FishiItUp! icon button.

Prerequisites:
--------------
- Auto Loot MUST be activatated. (Rift Menu->Interface->Misc->Auto Loot).
- Player MUST HAVE a fishing pole in his bags, if more then one is present the one requiring the highest skill will be choosen.
- To cast you HAVE TO use FishItUps!'s CAST icon, otherwise it wont track anything.
- To move windows around the screen you have you to RIGHT-click and drag windows.

Windows Explanation:
--------------------
Cast Window: 
Shows the icon of the highest skill requiring Fishinh Pole you have in your inventory, it is used to begin fishing and 
casting the fishing target. If you stop fishing and FishItUp! doesn't track it, you can click this icon again to force it 
to stop tracking.

Main Window: 
tracks zone, subzone if available, number of casts, number of catches and both the current fishing timer and the 
aggregated session time.

Loot Window: 
even if it's usually closed, it tracks details about what you have fished during this session, if you happened
to already have fished in that zone, it will show old loots along with the new ones.

Totals Widow: 
shows all your fishing totals divided by zone, clicking on the Zone Name shows detailed infos about what you
looted there.

Saved Data:
-----------
All chars share a global save file holding the cache with the detailed data about what is fished. Each char has one more
saved file, in its saved data directory holding session and totals data pinting to the shared cache.

Font:
-----
I use a custom monospaced font taken from http://www.myfonts.com/search/MonospaceTypewriter/, it should be free for anyone to use. 
The reason is trying to align some text inside the various windows.
